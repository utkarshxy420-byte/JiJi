        <h2 style="font-weight:700;">A Study on JIA</h2>
        <h3 style="font-style:italic;">Findings from prolonged exposure</h3>

        <p>This paper documents the accidental and ongoing discovery of Jia, an individual whose presence has been statistically proven to improve moments, conversations, and general atmosphere (Of which, only 15% is glaze which isn't a bad at all). The study began unintentionally and has not yet concluded.</p>

        <h4>1 - Introduction</h4>
        <p>Jia first appeared under normal circumstances. No anomalies were reported at the time, apart from maybe her very jolly personality which screamed <strong>NOTICE ME &gt;.&lt; I AM RIGHT HERE, LOOK AT ME.</strong> Which threw people off from suspecting her. This was later determined to be a failure of observation. She slipped unto the cracks within our observatory lab, and navigated almost perfectly to not let us catch a whiff of her anomalous existence. Later, she clouded herself with mist and haze to seem more cold, and opt a new persona which made her seem cooler than she may have been. The study takes in consideration of her change within this period and uses an overall average to metricize her not so metricizable being, yet for the sake of completion and dramatic effect, I give a fuck not.</p>

        <h4>2 - Methodology</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Shit talking behind others back</li>
          <li>Attempts to remain unaffected were unsuccessful</li>
          <li>Emotional neutrality could not be maintained</li>
          <li>Expectations were exceeded without warning</li>
          <li>Results did not align with initial assumptions</li>
          <li>Shared jokes of questionable quality</li>
          <li>Mutual overthinking</li>
          <li>Late-night discussions with no clear conclusion</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:0.85rem;">Errors were logged and quietly accepted.</p>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">Data was collected through repeated interactions, many of which were not intended to be meaningful and yet were.</p>

        <h4>3 - Observations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Exhibits rare balance of intelligence and chaos</li>
          <li>A rare ability to be funny without intending to</li>
          <li>Makes ordinary moments statistically better</li>
          <li>Possesses an unexplained ability to make silence comfortable</li>
          <li>Showcases a rather great listening and understanding fortitude</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5 - Discussion</h4>
        <p>While the mechanisms behind Jia’s impact remain unclear, the consistency of the results suggests significance beyond coincidence.</p>

        <h4>6 - Limitations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Sample size limited (one Jia)</li>
          <li>Researcher bias unavoidable</li>
          <li>Subject unaware of full impact</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7 - Conclusion</h4>
        <p>This study concludes that Jia is not merely notable, but essential to the context in which she exists.</p>
