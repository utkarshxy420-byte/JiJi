    title: "How Do I Even Reply To This",
    text: "I am genuinely overwhelmed in a way that hits different. Like SO SO ABOVE THE 9TH HEAVEN and also OH MY GAWDD HOW WILL I EVEN COME UP WITH A FITTING REPLY all at once. You'd probably say \"You don't have to feel pressured to reply to it all frs since it's a bday wish frs :3\" but honestly I'd say otherwise. Damned would I be if I didn't say what's on my mind. Even if I've said it before, there's always more to say.",

    content: "I just love how you express everything. That's such a vague definition so let me elaborate on the nuances. The random start, the ponderous note—that's so you. And I relate because that's how I usually start too. Not that I write like you, even though there's similarities, but your style has this refined flavor. Like it's been forged and hammered and tweaked to perfection to express those anomalous thoughts. Honestly if you sent this anonymously without the chai tea and other clues, I'd still know it was you. That's how distinctly you."

    text: "Real talk: as much time as I wasted on Atlantis, I don't regret it. Yeah I wish I spent more time on other productive things but fuck it, I know myself and I don't regret that era. It was a whole new world. A portal to something I'd never seen before. The domino effect of us finding that place... I wonder what would be different if that never happened.",

    content: "Funk fact btw: I read 'nicer' as 'nieer' and spent actual braincells trying to figure out what it meant. Thought it was Spanish. Then I zoomed in and saw the 'e' was actually a 'c'. 💀"

    title: "The Chocolate Era",
    text: "So like, you remember when I'd disappear for 2-3 days? You'd tag me saying 'GIyuu come back here's your daily chocolates 🍫🍫😔' and I'd see that and it'd just hit different. So wholesome and funny at the same time. And then I became your chocolate supplier even though you haven't paid for the last 3 batches lmao. But honestly? I'm pardoning that debt because the effort you put into making this is... it's a lot. I'm not gonna underestimate your ability to utilize your brain power here, especially when it's usually busy slacking off or sleeping.",
    type: "text",
    content: "Also a funk fact: as I'm writing this I got a chocolate from my cousin and I thought it'd be relevant to tell you. The chocolate enthusiast in me had to report it immediately. Peak comedy that we have this whole thing."

    title: "Before I Say Anything Else",
    text: "I just need you to know: there's something about how you exist that hits different. Not in an \"AI-ish\" way, just... genuinely. You're the kind of person where even the randomness makes sense because it's authentically you. The way you blend the chaotic with the real, the sarcastic with the heartwarming—that's rare. And yeah maybe I'm overthinking this but I don't care. This is what's on my mind.",
    type: "text",
    content: "You're 20 now. Two decades of being exactly who you are, refusing to change into something 'palatable,' just existing in your Jia-ness. And honestly? That's the most beautiful thing about you."
