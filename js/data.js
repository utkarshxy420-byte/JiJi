      <h2 style="font-weight:700;">A Study on JIA</h2>
      <p>This paper documents the accidental and ongoing discovery of Jia, whose presence appears to improve moments, conversations, and general atmosphere, despite no formal intent to do so. The researcher, being the lifeless bafoon that he is, spent an entire evening into the compilation of thoughts and data to express the "things i wouldn't say directly" due to an unintentional ego boost.</p>

      <h4>1 - Introduction</h4>
      <p>Jia first appeared under normal circumstances. No anomalies were reported at the time, apart from maybe her very jolly personality which screamed <strong>NOTICE ME &gt;.&lt; I AM RIGHT HERE, LOOK AT ME.</strong> Which threw people off from suspecting her. This was later determined to be a failure of observation. She slipped unto the cracks within our observatory lab, and navigated almost perfectly to not let us catch a whiff of her anomalous existence. Later, she clouded herself with mist and haze to seem more cold, and opt a new persona which made her seem cooler than she may have been. The study takes in consideration of her change within this period and uses an overall average to metricize her not so metricizable being, yet for the sake of completion and dramatic effect, I give a fuck not.</p>

      <h4>2 - Methodology</h4>
      <p>Data for this study was collected through largely unstructured interaction, occurring across varied platforms and said conditions were ever changing given the context of our prolonged observations. Our gratherings was collected during period of great cognitive stress and disorderly flow of thoughts and opinions. While the nondeliberate inquiry of the subject was but unknown for a major stretch in the timeline, the reasercher found himself the sherluck house of the presented variable and found it within his right to reach to a satisfactory explanation with explicit mention of who, how, where, when and why. The accuracy of the emotional graphs cannot be verified given the contraints of our data. The methodology relies less on accuracy, and more on the repeated patterns of her continued warm presence. It is self defining, rather than a push towards delieberate and rigid structure.</p>
      <p style="font-style:italic;">Data was collected through repeated interactions, many of which were not intended to be meaningful and yet were.</p>

      <h4>3 - Observation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Shit talking behind other's back and feel somewhat guilty for it, yet continue anyway.</li>
        <li>Attempts to remain nonchalant was but a mere feature that was never utilized.</li>
        <li>Simply cannot hide her bias, though, atleast she's honest.</li>
        <li>Play a rather uplifting role in other's morale and be the therapist they did not deserve but the therapist they got.</li>
        <li>Is very stern about what she wants and is willing to do the work for it.</li>
        <li>Shared overthinking braincell.</li>
        <li>Late night deranged discussions with the air filled in a sense of intoxication.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4 - Data &amp; Graphs</h4>
      <p>The figures below are integrated into the report for readability.</p>

      <h4>5 - Discussion</h4>
      <p>While the mechanisms behind Jia's impact remain unclear, the consistency of the results suggests that she brings with her, the ecosystem of greatfulness and sunshine as well as pettyness.</p>

      <h4>6 - Bonus</h4>
      <p><strong>How to deal with jia, a guide:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1 - Don't panic</li>
        <li>Step 2 - Panic anyways</li>
        <li>Step 3 - Realize she is actually not an ice princess but a cutie patootie human being with emotions believe it or not who lowkey care about others but sometimes wouldn't explicitly show them outwardly in an attempt to safegaurd herself from mean people.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7 - Limitations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sample size limited (one Jia)</li>
        <li>The researcher is indeed biased</li>
        <li>Time contraint proved rather unfateful in our study</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>8 - Conclusion</h4>
      <p>This study concludes that Jia is not merely notable, but essential to the context in which she exists.</p>

      <h4>9 - Appendix</h4>
      <h5>A: Terminology &amp; Definitions</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jia</strong> — Noun. A singular subject exhibiting warmth, intelligence, and disarming presence.</li>
        <li><strong>Normal Conversation</strong> — Noun. A conversation that unexpectedly becomes meaningful.</li>
        <li><strong>Silence</strong> — Noun. A shared state that does not require filling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-style:italic;">Some terms remain intentionally undefined.</p>

      <h5>B: Peer Review</h5>
      <p>Reviewer 1: "Is this nigga serious yooo"</p>
      <p>Reviewer 2: "Such level of intricacy has not been spoted since the light ages."</p>
      <p>Reviewer 3: "The subject seems to be a shining presence among the populace"</p>

      <h5>C: Acknowledgments</h5>
      <p>The author acknowledges Jia, without whom this study would not exist. The paper boasts an astounding level of emotional error and deliberate mischaracterization for comedic effect, mixed in with the truthful and bottom heart thoughts.</p>
      <p>I would like to thank both mine and Jia's parents for making us exist to make this even remotely feasible. I also acknowledge that I, did in fact find myself thoroughly amused and laughing at several key points during the whole run of my creative process. I wholly confess that I didn't give up when faced with a headache of what this site made the turmoil inside of me evolve into, and extend a heartfelt thank you to my patience for sticking with me till the end, and to you, yes, YOU, for reading all this so far and hopefully enjoying my flow of incoherency.</p>

      <h5>D: Future Work</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Continued observation</li>
        <li>Expanded time constraint</li>
        <li>More fellow researchers to omit personal bias</li>
      </ul>

    title: "Anyways",
        text: `<p>Putting all the bs aside. Making this was hella fun I can't even lie. The extra, the not enough, everything. Moreover, it forced me to elaborate you in words, which I must say, is both an easy and hard task. Easy because I have known you for long and well enough for however long you and I have talked, and hard because some aspects I can't quite put a handle on. But I tried to nonetheless. This was such a throwback to the time when I made you the chatroom stuff, and I had to learn, which I did very enthusiastically as it comes under my area of interest.</p>
          <p>Funfact, everytime I make a wish which include multiple files and information that is depicted/ or edited and made by images as a base, I make a folder on their name. I have a folder named "Goldie" which is now filled with canva and pinterest material I used for her wish, as well as some random downloads, files, screenshots, documents etcetra, which happened because of my lazyness to change the default location. Same with one named "Kaju" and now the newest addition being "Jia". You are now free to go continue with the rest of the wish on discord. Also the earlier vision of the site, was quite different from what it turned out, it was supposed to be more whimisy, more cutesy, and I suppose, matched the vibe. Instead of a professional corporate style, however, my dear friend, and also the supposed graphic designer of this site, otherwise known as goldie. Continued to give me false hope which never came. I stand, betrayed by my own kin shared braincell. This site, is immortal, in all the good and bad days, in any season, year, or mood, it exists as a reminder of my will, and a form of appreciation. So have a memorable 20th birthday.</p>`,
